# Buried Treasure (buried_treasure)

A simple minetest mod enhancing the drop of default items (dirt, sand, leaves)
with hidden items such as: 

1) minecoins (from krock's bitchange mod) hidden in dirt and sand

2) bird's egg--useful for food recipes, where animal products are desired 
without the added lag of mobs. 

3) magical feathers increasing a players mana on use.

Eggs and feathers support all default mintest_game leaves(tree, jungle, pine, acacia, aspen)
as well as offering optional support for moretrees.
